# Homework Week 1
### 2024-03-08
In our first session of week 1, we experimented with our newly developed skills in p5 to build a creative piece with code. Through utilising squares, colours, and forms of movement, we were able to create something fascinating!

For this weeks homework, our first goal is to try learn how to create a grid based on the skills we learnt this week.

I first attempted to get the squares still, so I had gotten rid of the framecount and left the constand at 10, thinking it would keep the size at 10 but this wasn't the case. The squares stopped moving but were all different sizes from one another as if they were stuck in their first state of movement.

In hopes of adjusting the height and width of the squares, I thought that by changing the numbers in both the height and the width it would change all the squares to one size. Instead, it left only one very small square! At this point, perhaps it's worth starting from the beginning.

I started again by creating a canvas using the setup function, and I was able to set a canvas for 400x400 to create a well-sized square. From this point, I will try create a coloured square like I had done in last classes tutorial.
