# A1: Cute! Documentation
#### Published 2023-03-31
### Introduction 
This first creative coding assignment requres us to explore the conventions of a 'Cute!' creative genre in p5. However, this first poses the question of: what makes a creative coding piece 'Cute'? This is something I hope to explore and iterate on upon further research and implementation of practice. I will also look to the works of artists such as RafaÃ«l Rozendaal and course content to build my knowledge further.

### Reading Sianne Ngai - Zany, Cute, Interesting (Wark 2020)

The aesthetic idea of 'cute' derives from the word acute (Wark, 2020), creating a cute version of a more-so edgy word. Ngai delves into the contrast yet astonishing balance of the 'zany' and 'cute'. The sharp and the fuzzy. The zany focuses on the 'performance' of objects, whilst the cute represent the 'being' of the subject in itself. To see and imagine the genre of cute, we must understand first the contextual ideas behind it.

The word cute, or kawaii in Japanese sounds almost to similar as Kowai - scary. From this alone, we are almost able to understand, see, and feel the affect of this genre. That the cute can be sweet, but biting and chaotic (Wark, 2020).

From this reading, my understanding of the cute phenomenon and intricately simple aesthetic is that; the cute requires a balance between coherance and a little bit of chaos. This brings about a feeling of interest within an aesthetic composition of work due to its sweet aesthetic, and the movement between calm and subtle chaos. This is something I hope I'll be able to achieve in my assignment, therefore i will take into consideration the use of colour, shape, and composition.
